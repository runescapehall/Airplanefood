ATLANTA, — Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) introduced today its new Business class menu on flights to and from Mexico City. The menu, which had been in planning and testing for the past six-months, takes the pleasure of eating on board to a new level with regionally inspired meals designed by Chef Michelle Bernstein.

“It is an absolute honor and pleasure to be creating menus with Delta for one of my favorite gastronomic areas of the world, Mexico”, said Bernstein. “I truly hope customers will enjoy some of the inspirations and flavors of Mexico that I have added to the recipes. I will never forget my first trip to Oaxaca and tasting Mole Negro for the first time, a taste I hope to never forget; or walking the streets of Mexico City sharing the best Tacos Al Pastor, I never knew existed; Veracruz for its amazing fish dishes; and Puebla for its Mole Poblano. This has been the most enjoyable menu I have created thus far for Delta. Buen provecho!”

The new Business class meals will be featured in all flights between Mexico City and the United States. Some of the new entrees showcased on the breakfast menu are Huevos a la Mexicana, Breakfast Burritos and Chocolate Pancakes. On the lunch/dinner menu some of the selections for first course include Black Bean Hummus andTortilla Española. Examples of the main course are Turkey Albondigas with Sofrito Sauce and Braised Short Ribs with Mole Sauce.
